    <p>
        I’m Deepak — an aspiring Computer Science and Engineering student and a dedicated learner who enjoys building modern, clean, and efficient digital experiences.
        My interests include software development, problem-solving, and continuous improvement. I thrive on understanding how things work and applying that knowledge to create practical,
        real-world projects.

    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">
        Outside of tech, I spend a lot of time reading (mostly fiction and sci-fi/fantasy) and playing video games. Both give me new perspectives, spark creativity, and push me to think in different ways — something I bring into my coding projects as well.
I’m excited to keep improving, create meaningful projects, and collaborate with people who share similar interests.
        
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">
        My goal is simple: keep learning, keep building, and create things I'm proud of.
